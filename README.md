# My Langton's Ant Python (pygame)
This is my recreation of Langton's Ant in Pygame. 

## Background
The ant moves in a grid and changes its direction based on the tile's color. The full description of the algorithm is linked here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant.
For my version, it was written in Pygame (which is a game engine framework for Python). I could've made this on the GPU and did the movements per-pixel but this was easier to work with. 
I didn't want to post a version of this here until it was made well enough for you to see the whole simulation. There's still room for improvement but it works good.
